Instagram Client built using MVP and RxJava/Retrofit

Was done as part of a one day programming test

![Demo](https://github.com/seanleavy/ShowpiecePhotos/blob/master/demo.gif)

Simple Instagram client that displays User Profile and Recent Posts

Instagram API sandboxing:

Instagram rules state that any user must have permission of the app creator to oauth when using their api. 
Unfortunately this means having to invite every new user into the sandbox until Instagram approves the app.
